# Gridview-Images-from-Camera-and-Gallery

This is a simple app that adds images to a gridview. 
The images could either be added from a camera or from the existing gallery images. 
This application has three buttons. 
1->CAMERA button opens the camera and upon clicking a photo, adds the photo onto the gridview.
2->GALLERY button opens the gallery, the user can choose among the available folders for whichever image he/she wants.
   This just allows the user to select a single image.
3->CLEAR ALL button simply clears contents off from the gridview.

This code is written in Kotlin. 
Thank you!
